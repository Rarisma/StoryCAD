It began to attract attention at writer's conferences (I had a very early laptop), and in the early 90's I had the dubious idea of polishingit and selling it commercially. StoryBuilder had modest success, selling over 3,000 copies, but inevitably software rot set in as my day job consumed more of time andenergy, and first fell into disuse and then became unusable. The original StoryBuilderis the ancestor of this one version.After I retired, I had the dubious idea of rewriting StoryBuilder and selling it again,and started down that road. However, looking at my tired old face in the mirror one morning, I came to realize that I wasn't interested in going into business again. Iwasn't interested in scrappng my project either, which realization led to the decisionto distribute StoryBuilder as free and open source software (FOSS.)## Software InfluencesUnless I'm deluding myself, version 2.0 of StoryBuilder is a better programthan the original. That's because I know the trick of how to write bettersoftware: You shamelessly shamelessly good ideas and code patterns from other developers.Five individuals and their work deserve mention for this reason.Laurent Bugnion, Galasoft, MVVM Light Toolkithttps://github.com/lbugnion/mvvmlightPerigrin66, Pergrine's View, StaffManagerhttp://peregrinesview.uk/mvvm-bringing-it-all-together/Diederik Krols, XAML Brewer, Using a TreeView Control for Navigation in UWPhttps://xamlbrewer.wordpress.com/2018/06/08/using-a-treeview-control-for-navigation-in-uwp/comment-page-1/#comment-296Ryan Demopouloshttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/Michael Hawker (XAML Llama)https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/windowscommunitytoolkit## Writing InfluencesGMC: Goal, Motivation & Conflict, Debora Dixon, StoryBuilder handles story structure in terms of its building blocks,story elements: Problem, Character, Setting, and Scene.
