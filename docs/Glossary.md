act: A major division of a play or opera.  Subdivisions of acts are called scenes or episodes.

action: The events which unfold in a story and which answer the question  'What happens next?'  Action comes from characters who do things in order to achieve their goals or overcome obstacles.

ambiance: The mood or tone of a situation.

anima: The inner personality of a character.  See 'persona'.  A term from Jungian psychology.

atmosphere: The dominant impression a story creates through such elements as setting and dialog.

C

catastrophe: A misfortune or disaster, usually sudden.   A plot in which events result in an outcome not in line with the protagonist's goals.

catharsis: The purging of emotions.  Aristotle wrote that the effect of tragedy upon the audience  is a purification of the spirit through the discharge of emotions, with the resulting relief from tension.

cause and effect: In stories, events must have a reason, rather than occur through coincidence.  Causes are usually the actions of characters, and are based on motives.

chapter: A main division of a book, usually numbered, but sometimes titled. Since you don't want the reader to quit reading, arrange your chapter breaks so that chapters end at places of high dramatic tension.

character: A person represented in a story.  Character is the sum of the traits and features which distinguish one person from another; the storyteller creates character by selecting these qualities.

climax: The point of maximum dramatic intensity which occurs at a turning point or crisis.

coincidence: An event which occurs through random chance.  Readers don't often accept coincidence in fiction, but demand cause and effect.

comedy: A story of light and cheerful tone with a happy ending.

conflict: The struggle between opposing forces.  Conflict is the force which drives the events which comprise the plot.

counterplot: A subplot  in a story which contrasts to the principal plot line.  For example, scenes which depict the antagonist's actions can be a counterplot.

crisis: A turning point in a story, at which a choice or change or decision must occur.  Climax refers to the emotional intensity a crisis should generate.

D

details: Specific and particular items or features.  Effective stories rely on details rather than generalizations, particularly in characterization, settings, and props.

dramatis personae: A list of the characters in a story and their relationships or roles.  Printed in the program of a play or at the beginning of a literary work.

fiction: A literary work created from imagination and designed to entertain the reader.  'Effective fiction makes readers think, but the primary purpose of all fiction is to make readers feel.' --- H. Shaw.

foreshadowing: Writing events into a story which foretell a later event, so that when the later event occurs, it will have more impact or seem more believable.

foreshortened prose: Contracted or abridged narration which summarizes  story events or scenes.  Foreshortened prose can compress large stretches of time into a few words,  but is less graphic and compelling than writing in scenes.

formula: A plot created according to stereotyped or set forms.  Most stories follow a formula at a base level.  Good stories transcend formula through attention to  detail and complexity of characterization, motive, situation, and setting..

historical novel: A novel which is a fictional representation of actual historical events or persons.

I

in media res: Starting a story in the middle of the events the story relates, rather than at their beginning.  This is often done to provide a narrative hook, by opening with an action scene.

T

tale: A story which narrates (usually in the first person) the details of some incident in the story's 'past.'  The narration is a form of 'frame.'

theme: The story's unifying idea, or motif.  Theme can be  a category, such as idea-based or character-driven, but in  common usage theme often means the story's moral or premise.  The  story's outcome and cast should support the theme.  See 'premise.'

three-act play: A formula for fiction derived from the five acts Aristotle described in his Poetics.  The formula is structured around the modern three-act stage play and describes which story elements should occur in which act, and by inference, the logical order of material in any dramatic story.
