# About StoryBuilder

Our mission is to provide a free resource for writers of all levels who struggle with 
the complexity of plotted fiction. 

StoryBuilder is an editor for fiction outlines 
from which writers can quickly create working drafts. It uses best-practices techniques, 
and offers hundreds hundreds of suggestions for better stories. It's CAD for fiction
writers.

The elements StoryBuilder works with are the elements of good fiction: realistic three 
dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic 
and suspenseful plots, and settings that appeal to the senses.

## Built With

* [WinUI 3][1]
* [Windows App SDK][2]
* [Windows Community Toolkit][3]
* [elmah.io][4]
* [NRtfTree][5]
* [Scrivener][6]
* [SyncFusion][7]

WinUI has announced plans to make their code available as open source.

Windows Community Toolkit is available under the [MIT License][14].

Elmah.io is a commerical cloud-based error logging and uptime monitor service. Elmah.io graciously provides
a [free subscription][15] to public repository open source projects. We are grateful for their support.

NRtfTree is available under the [GNU GPL V3 License][16]. StoryBuilder has modified this software locally to allow
asynchronous IO.

Scrivener is a commercial writing application widely used by novelists, screenwriters, playwrights, and short fiction writers. 
StoryBuilder contains a feature which inserts StoryBuilder
reports into a Scrivener project using their Scrivener 3 File Formatting Specification API. 

[SyncFusion WinUI Controls] is a commercial toolkit of controls for WinUI 3 projects. StoryBuilder uses their ComboBox
control extensively. Syncfusion graciously provides an [Open Source Project License][17].  We are grateful for their support.   


## Getting Started

StoryBuilder is an odd duck, with its feet in two ponds: the user community of writers
and the community of developers.

### For writers

If you are (or want to be) a fiction writer, welcome! StorBuilder was written 
for you. An introduction to StoryBuilder 
for users is the [User Documentation][9].

You're invited welcome try the software for itself (it's free.) StoryBuilder is 
currently in beta test. If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, please 
email tcox@svsoft.com and ask for a copy of the software.

Complete documentation can be found in the [User Manual][8], which also serves
as online help for the program.

### For Developers

If you're developer, welcome! A good starting place is to learn more about StoryBuilder,
using the same resources for writer/users.

Once you've read through this document are familiar with the program, take a look at 
[Programmer Notes][10].

### Installation

The StoryBuilder repository is maintained with Visual Studio. Either VS2019 or VS2022 will work. The Community editions of these products are free
and can be downloaded from [here][11].

StoryBuilder is developed with the Windows App SDK. Set up your development as per [this guide][12]. We are currently running version 1.0.

You can test your installation by building and running a new app using the Blank App, Packaged (WinUI 3 in Desktop) template as described in the documentation.

In Visual Studio, clone the Storybuilder repository from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/terrycox/StoryBuilder-2.git

Build and run the solution.


## Usage

We will provide a program demo video in the near future.

## Roadmap

StoryBuilder's immediate plans are orgainized as a series of [GitHub Projects][18].

We are currently working on the [Clean Up StoryBuilder][19] project.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

Our next goal, which we are also working on, is to attract
