# StoryCAD Roadmap

#### Last Updated: 2023-04-04
Dear Writers,

We are excited to announce that with the next release, 2.10.0.0, our application, StoryBuilder, is being rebranded as StoryCAD - computer aided design for fiction writers. Exciting new features are coming soon!

We believe that the name, StoryCAD, better reflects the value we offer our users. Our software goes beyond just building stories - it provides you with a comprehensive set of design tools that helps you craft unique and captivating narratives. Novel, screenplay, or any other fiction type, StoryCAD will help you organise your thoughts and turn your ideas into polished works of art.

StoryCAD continues to be available through the Microsoft Store. For now our website, at https://storybuilder.org/, and our GitHub repositories at https://github.com/storybuilder.org, will remain, although both will refer to the new StoryCAD brand.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to sharing this new chapter with you.

Regards, The StoryCAD Team
