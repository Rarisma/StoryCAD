# About StoryBuilder

Our mission is to provide a free resource for writers of all levels who struggle with 
the complexity of plotted fiction. StoryBuilder is an editor for fiction outlines 
from which writers can quickly create working drafts. It uses best-practices techniques, 
and offers hundreds hundreds of suggestions for better stories. It's CAD for fiction
writers.

The elements StoryBuilder works with are the elements of good fiction: realistic three 
dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic 
and suspenseful plots, and settings that appeal to the senses.

## Getting Started

StoryBuilder is an odd duck, with its feet in two ponds: the user community of writers
and the community of developers.

### For writers

If you're strictly in the writer camp, welcome! An introduction to StoryBuilder 
for users is the [User Documentation][9].

You're invited welcome try the software for itself (it's free.) StoryBuilder is 
currently in beta test. If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, please 
email tcox@svsoft.com and ask for a copy of the software.

Complete documentation can be found in the [User Manual][8], which also serves
as online help for the program.

### For Developers

If you're developer, welcome! A good starting place is to learn more about StoryBuilder,
using the same resources for writer/users.

Once you've read through this document are familiar with the program, take a look at 
[Programmer Notes][10].
