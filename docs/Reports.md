Reports

Clicking on the Reports button on the Menu Bar displays a fly-out menu with two reporting options:

![][Print-Reports-Button-and-Menu]


Print Reports

If you select the Print Reports option, a dialog will appear which allows you to check the particular reports you wish to print:

![][Generate-Reports-Dialog]

Clicking Generate will cause all of the selected reports to print on your default printer.

Scrivener Reports

If you use Scrivener, clicking Scrivener Reports will open a file picker to allow you to select a Scrivener .scrivx file from a Scrivener project. The Scrivener project you select is the one you’ll be writing your draft in, and it must have been created before you generate the reports.

![][Scrivener-Reports-File-Picker]

When the reports are done:    ![][Scrivener-Reports-Generated-Status-Message]  you can open your Scrivener project. You’ll see a set of nodes added to the Binder, which contain your reports:

![][Scrivener-Binder-with-StoryBuilder-Outline]

A convenient way to use these embedded reports is to split your screen, with one pane open to a text node in the Manuscript and the other to a node in the outline:
