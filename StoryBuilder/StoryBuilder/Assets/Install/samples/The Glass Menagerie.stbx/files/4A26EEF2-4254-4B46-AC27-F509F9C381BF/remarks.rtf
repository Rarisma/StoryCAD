\pard\tx720\cf1\f0\fs25 Tom, dressed as a merchant sailor, strolls to fire escape, lights cigarette, addresses audience. "I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion. I turn back time to the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. This play is memory. Being memory, it is dimly lighted, sentimental, not realistic. In memory everything happens to music, which explains the fiddle in the wings." He describes the characters, including the gentleman caller who is an emissary from the world of reality and a symbol of the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for. He also describes the fifth character, the father, who doesn't appear in the play other than in the picture. This father left them a long time ago.\par
