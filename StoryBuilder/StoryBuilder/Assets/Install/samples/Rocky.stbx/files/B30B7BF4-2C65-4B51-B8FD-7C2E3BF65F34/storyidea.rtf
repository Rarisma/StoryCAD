\pard\tx720\cf1\f0\fs23       Written in the mid seventies by a relatively unknown actor named Sylvester Stallone, this  updated version of the underdog master plot became a box office hit  and spawned four sequels. \par
     As the Hollywood legend has it, Stallone wouldn't sell the script unless he could play the lead.  When United Artists agreed, a star was born, along with a modern classic.\par
     Rocky looses his big fight, but that just underscores the story's theme: a man's body can be defeated, but not his soul.    \par
    The characters make this story. There's Rocky, the part-time loan shark enforcer who hates to hurt people, and who has  the heart of a lion.  Adriane is a mouse-like, timid spinster who shines when shown a little love.  Mickey,  the ferocious has-been trainer, won't let his age and weak heart  stand in the way of his dream. Apollo Creed, the champion, is a flashy showman, but in the big fight he shows how he became champion in the first place.  \par
