\pard\tx720\cf1\f0\fs23   Mrs. Linde is dispirited and hesitant. Nora can hardly recognize her; she's changed in the ten years since they last saw each other, paler, thinner, and older-looking. Nora is apologetic about not writing when Mrs. Linde was widowed three years ago. Her husband left her with no money and no children, but Mrs. Linde says she doesn't have a sense of loss.\par
  Nora tells her own tale. Shortly after they were married, Tovald grew ill from overwork. The doctors told him he must travel south if wished to live. They spent a year in Italy, at huge expense; Nora says she got the money from her father just before he died.\par
  Mrs. Linde says that she married not from love, but because she had an ill mother and two young brothers to look after. Her husband was well off, but he left her bereft. \par
  Nora decides that she'll get Tovald to give Mrs. Lunde a job.\par
She also confides her big secret: she raised the money to save her husband, scimping and saving.\par
